description	"The DHCP Leases application is a BloxOne DDI service that stores information about leases. Please note that hosts are authoritative for their lease data. Changes to leases are periodically replicated to the cloud and stored by this service for display purposes. There is no lease history, so only current leases are available. In other words, every dhcp/host_lease or dhcp/lease for that matter, represents a lease that is currently active. Note that fixed addresses do not have leases.\n\n"
