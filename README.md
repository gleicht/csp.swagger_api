Baseline Swagger api calls for diffing purposes
The baseline Swagger API calls were scrapped from the Cloud Services portal on 10-01-2020. 
The intent of the baseline calls are to run diffs against on a timely basis (actual time period still to be determined)so that future iterations of the Swagger API calls can be compared aginst the baseline document to identify changes. 
As of october 1, 2020, there are a total of nine API callls. Four API calls each for BloxOne DDI and BloxOne Threat Defense, one API call for BloxOne Cloud (Anycast).
